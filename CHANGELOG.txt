In Development

 * The corresponding row in the rank table is now deleted when a ticket is
   deleted.

 * Implemented a better algorithm for assigning a default rank when tickets have
   been deleted.

 * Added some checks to detect ranks without tickets and tickets without ranks,
   and clean up the tables.  These new checks will require you to run a
   trac-admin env upgrade.

 * Changed queries to use single quotes for better compatibility with
   PostgreSQL.

TracBacklog 0.3.0 (March 1, 2013)

 * Added the ability to send tickets to the top or bottom via a context menu.
   A huge thanks to Brent Atkinson for implementing this feature.

 * TICKET_MODIFY is no longer required to view the backlog, only TICKET_VIEW.
   Modifying the backlog now requires BACKLOG_MODIFY.  Patch by Brent Atkinson.

 * Added a preference pane to allow users to customize what they see in the
   backlog.  Patch by Brent Atkinson.

 * Added a Content-Length to the response header, allowing tracd to work
 * correctly.  Patch by Hiroyuki Wada.
